'''
LOOP ITEMS:
- You can loop through the set items by using a for loop
'''
# example: (loop through the set and print the values)
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
for x in thisset:
    print(x)

# EXERCISE: What is the correct syntax for looping through the item of a set?
# 1.) for x in {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}:
#       print(x)        # correct
# 2.) for x in {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry}
#       print(x)
# 3.) foreach x in {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}:
#       print(x)
