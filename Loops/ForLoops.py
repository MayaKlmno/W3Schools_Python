PYTHON FOR LOOPS:
- A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is 
  either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string)
- This is less like the for keyword in other programming lanugages,
  and works more like an iterator method as found in other
  object-orienated programming languages.
- With the for loop we can execute a set ofstatements, one
  for each item in a list, tuple, set, etc.
